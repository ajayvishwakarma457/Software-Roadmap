Git Roadmap (Beginner → Senior → Expert)

    🟢 Beginner (Foundations)
        Goal: Work confidently with local + remote repositories


    Core Concepts
        What is Git, VCS, distributed vs centralized
        Repository, working tree, staging area, commit
        SHA, HEAD, branch, tag

    
    Essential Commands
        git init, git clone
        git status, git add, git commit
        git log, git diff
        git branch, git checkout, git switch
        git merge
        git remote, git fetch, git pull, git push


    Daily Workflow
        Feature branch workflow
        Commit messages (imperative, small commits)
        .gitignore

    
    Must-Practice
        Create repo → commit → push
        Resolve simple merge conflict
        Clone & contribute to a repo

    🟡 Intermediate / Mid-Level (Professional Usage)
        Goal: Collaborate safely and manage real projects

    
    Branching & History
        Branch strategies: Git Flow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-based
        Fast-forward vs non-FF merge
        Rebase vs merge (when & why)
        Squash commits


    Tags & Releases
        Lightweight vs annotated tags
        Semantic Versioning (v1.2.3)
        Release tagging strategy


    Collaboration
        Pull Requests / Merge Requests
        Code reviews
        Handling conflicts correctly
        Fork-based workflow


    Advanced Commands
        git rebase -i
        git cherry-pick
        git stash
        git reset (soft / mixed / hard)
        git revert


    Safety & Hygiene
        Never rewrite shared history
        Clean commit history
        Recover mistakes (git reflog)


================================================================================================================================================================

    🔵 Senior (Production & Scale)
        Goal: Control history, scale teams, and prevent failures


    Git Internals (Must-Know)
        Objects: blob, tree, commit, tag
        Index (staging) internals
        How Git stores data
        Packfiles & garbage collection


    Advanced Workflows
        Monorepo Git strategies
        Submodules vs Subtrees
        Release branches & hotfix flows
        Long-lived vs short-lived branches


    Automation
        Git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push)
        CI/CD triggers using Git
        Enforcing commit standards
        Automated versioning


    Debugging & Recovery
        Bisect (git bisect)
        Deep reflog usage
        Recover deleted branches
        Fix broken histories
    
    Security
        Signed commits & tags (GPG)
        Secret scanning
        Access control best practices


================================================================================================================================================================

    Governance
        Branch protection rules
        Release governance
        Audit-ready histories
        Compliance & traceability


    Tooling & Ecosystem
