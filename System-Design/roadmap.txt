    🧠 How to Study (No-Nonsense)
        Learn concept → trade-offs
        Design on paper / whiteboard
        Always ask:
            What breaks first?
            How do we scale?
            What if a node dies?
        Read real-world architectures
        Practice explaining designs verbally
