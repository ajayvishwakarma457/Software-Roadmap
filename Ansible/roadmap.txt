Ansible Roadmap (Beginner → Senior → Expert)


    🟢 Beginner (Foundations)
        Goal: Understand what Ansible is and automate basic tasks.

    
    Core Concepts
        What Ansible is, agentless architecture
        Control node vs managed nodes
        Inventory (INI, YAML)
        Ad-hoc commands
        SSH basics

    
    YAML & Playbooks
        YAML syntax
        Playbooks, plays, tasks
        Modules (file, copy, package, service, user, command, shell)
        Handlers
        Variables & facts


    Hands-on
        Install Ansible
        Write first playbook
        Manage packages & services on Linux
        Use ansible-doc

    
================================================================================================================================================================

    🟡 Intermediate (Production Ready)
        Goal: Write reusable, maintainable playbooks.

    Playbook Structure
        Roles (defaults, vars, tasks, handlers, templates)
        Include vs import
        Templates (Jinja2)
        Conditionals (when)
        Loops
        Tags

    
    Inventory & Variables
        Dynamic inventory
        Group vars & host vars
        Variable precedence
        Vault (secrets management)

    Error Handling
        ignore_errors
        failed_when
        changed_when
        Blocks / rescue / always

    Testing & Linting
        ansible-lint
        Dry runs (--check)
        Diff mode

    Hands-on
        Build reusable roles
        Secure secrets with Vault
        Deploy a multi-service app
